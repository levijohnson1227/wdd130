   <h2>Levi Johnson</h2>
   <p>Hi everyone! My name is Levi Johnson and I am studying software engineering as my major and minoring in buisness management. I am not entirely sure what I want to purse after my degree but I am currently intrested in buisness and tech so I'm sure it will work out.
     I have been married for almost two years now and my wife manages a bakery in Ridgy. My wife and I are both from southern Arizona in a town called Sahuarita which is about 45 min from the mexico border.<p>
    <p>My biggest hobbie right now is basketball. A group of friends and I play about three days a week at 5:30 in the morning. I also like to Golf but the snow in rexburg makes that a seasonal hobbie. Other than that I like to do anything outdoors or play any sport. I work for a company based out of Logan, Utah called Conservice. They are in utility billing indusrty so in short terms my job is to make sure our clients are being billed properly by various providers.</p>
    <p>I am excited for this class and to learn more about web development. </p>
